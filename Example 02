#Simple Use of NumPy: Working with Numbers Efficiently
#Example: Calculate Total and Average Marks of Students

import numpy as np

# Marks of 5 students in a subject
marks = np.array([78, 85, 90, 66, 88])

# Total marks
total = np.sum(marks)

# Average marks
average = np.mean(marks)

print("Total Marks:", total)
print("Average Marks:", average)
