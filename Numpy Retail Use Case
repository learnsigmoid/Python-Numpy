#Retail Use Case: Daily Sales & Performance Analysis
#You are analyzing 30 days of retail sales for 5 products in a store

#Step 1: Represent Retail Sales Data with NumPy


import numpy as np

# Daily units sold for 5 products over 30 days
sales = np.array([
    [12, 8, 15, 10, 5],
    [14, 7, 18, 12, 6],
    [11, 9, 14, 11, 4],
    [16, 10, 20, 13, 8],
    [10, 6, 12, 9, 3],
    # imagine this continues for 30 days
])

print("Shape of data:", sales.shape)

#Step 2: Total Sales per Product (Top Seller)
total_sales_per_product = np.sum(sales, axis=0)
print("Total sales per product:", total_sales_per_product)

#Step 3: Average Daily Sales per Product
avg_sales_per_product = np.mean(sales, axis=0)
print("Average daily sales:", avg_sales_per_product)

#Step 4: Daily Store Performance
daily_total_sales = np.sum(sales, axis=1)
print("Total units sold per day:", daily_total_sales)

#Step 5: Detect High & Low Sales Days (Outliers)
mean = np.mean(daily_total_sales)
std = np.std(daily_total_sales)

high_sales_days = daily_total_sales > (mean + std)
low_sales_days = daily_total_sales < (mean - std)

print("High sales days:", high_sales_days)
print("Low sales days:", low_sales_days)

#Step 6: Revenue Calculation (Vectorized – FAST)
prices = np.array([100, 150, 80, 120, 200])  # price per unit

daily_revenue = np.dot(sales, prices)
print("Daily revenue:", daily_revenue)

#Step 7: Monthly Revenue Summary
total_revenue = np.sum(daily_revenue)
avg_daily_revenue = np.mean(daily_revenue)

print("Total revenue:", total_revenue)
print("Average daily revenue:", avg_daily_revenue)
